# use_word_in_sentence
Fetches how a word(s) is(are) used in a sentence of words from www.merriam-webster.com to cut down time clicking, copying-pasting to save offline. Created this script when I was studying for a Vocabulary exam [the Verbal section of the GRE Graduate Record Examination.]
write the words you want in a program with a spelling checker like microsoft word because the program stops if a word's spelling is wrong and then after making sure all the words are right copy them to the word variable in the scrips as shown below:


```words='abjure,adumbrate,anathema,anodyne,apogee,apostate,apotheosis,asperity,asseverate,assiduous,augury,bellicose,calumniate,captious,cavil,celerity,chimera,contumacious,debacle,denouement,descry,desuetude,desultory,diaphanous,diffident,dirge,encomium,eschew,excoriate,execrate,exegesis,expiate,extirpate,fatuous,fractious,gainsay,heterodox,imbroglio,indefatigable,ineluctable,inimitable,insouciant,inveterate,jejune,lubricious,mendicant,meretricious,minatory,nadir,nonplussed,obstreperous,ossified,palliate,panegyric,parsimonious,pellucid,peroration,plangent,prolix,propitiate,puerile,puissance,pusillanimous,remonstrate,sagacious,salacious,salutary,sanguine,saturnine,sententious,stentorian,stygian,sycophant,tendentious,timorous,tyro,vitiate,voluble'```

The words are enclosed by single comma as you'll see when you open the script.
The meaning and uses of the words will be written on a file called beyondHitParade2.txt which you'll need to manually delete garbage and empty lines from until I imporve the script. It is an inconveniece but it still beats copying and pasting every single word manually online! I think this simple script saved me hours of copying-clicking-pasting!

If you encounter any issues please open an issue!
