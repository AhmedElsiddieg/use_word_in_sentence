# use_word_in_sentence
Fetches how a word(s) is(are) used in a sentence of words from www.merriam-webster.com to cut down time clicking, copying-pasting to save offline. Created this script when I was studying for a Vocabulary exam [the Verbal section of the GRE Graduate Record Examination.]
write the words you want in a program with a spelling checker like microsoft word because the program stops if a word's spelling is wrong
Open the script in any editor and write the words you need in the words variable. The words are enclosed by single commas as you'll see when you open the script.
If you encounter any issues please open an issue!
